        <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px;">
          <p>The uploading rules below are overwhelmingly long and detailed for a reason. The length is necessary to explain the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each rule is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold text</span> before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the <a href="#Index">Index</a>. The corresponding <a href="#">&uarr;</a> (move one level up) and <a href="#Index">rule section links</a> (move down into the document) help provide quick navigation.</p>
          <p>Before you upload anything, if you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions at any of the following points of site user support: <a href="staff.php">First-Line Support</a>, <a href="forums.php?action=viewforum&amp;forumid=8">the Help Forum</a>, or <a href="wiki.php?action=article&amp;name=IRC"><?=BOT_HELP_CHAN?> on IRC</a>. Send a <a href="staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff if other support has directed you to a moderator or if support has been unhelpful in your particular case. If you find any dead or broken links in the upload rules, send a <a href="staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff, and include in your message the upload rule number (e.g. <a href="#r2.4.3">2.4.3</a>) and preferably the correct link to replace the broken one.</p>

      <h4 id="def"><a href="#defk"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> Definitions</h4>
      <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px;">
        <p>There are many terms used in these rules that are generally poorly defined. For the sake of clarity, we will define those words as we mean them in this section.</p>

      <h5 id="h1.1"><a href="#h1.1k"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#h1.1">1.1.</a> General</h5>
        <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px;">

            <li id="r1.1.1"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.1">1.1.1.</a>
              <strong>Only movies, anime, manga, and games are allowed on the site.</strong> <?=SITE_NAME?> is a porn site. The only expections to this rule live in the 'Other' category, which is explained in its own section.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.2"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.2">1.1.2.</a>
              <strong>Uploads should be pornographic.</strong> Again, this is a porn site. If you're in doubt, ask yourself, "does this make me wanna whack my gack?" If the answer is "no", don't upload it.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.3"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.3">1.1.3.</a>
              <strong>Uploads should be Japanese in origin.</strong> Do not upload Western content without express permission from staff.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.4"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.4">1.1.4.</a>
              <strong>Duplicate torrents in any category are not allowed.</strong> There are some exceptions to this rule, which are outlined in their relevant sections below.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.5"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.5">1.1.5.</a>
              <strong>Seed complete copies of your uploads.</strong> Do not upload a torrent unless you intend to seed until there are at least 1.0 distributed copies. Seeding past this minimum is strongly encouraged.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.6"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.6">1.1.6.</a>
              <strong>No advertising or personal credits.</strong> Providing artist, studio, publisher, or retailer information is not considered advertising.
              <ul>
                <li id="r1.1.6.1"><a href="#h1.1.6"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.6.1">1.1.6.1</a>
                  <strong>Do not advertise sites, groups, or persons in torrent contents (e.g., folder names, file names, or file tags).</strong>
                </li>
                <li id="r1.1.6.2"><a href="#h1.1.6"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.6.2">1.1.6.2</a>
                  <strong>Do not advertise sites, groups, or persons in torrent descriptions.</strong> Exception: torrent source information (e.g. ripper, scene group, crack group, or original uploader credit) is allowed in torrent descriptions.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.7"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.7">1.1.7.</a>
              <strong>Archived files in uploads are not allowed in Movies and Anime.</strong> Manga, Games, and  "Other" uploads may be archived. Specific archival rules can be found in their respective sections.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.8"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.8">1.1.8.</a>
              <strong>English and Japanese are the the languages of <?=SITE_NAME?>.</strong> Torrents with neither English nor Japanese audio or text are forbidden. Torrents with dual audio that contain other languages in addition to English and/or Japanese are acceptable, however.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.9"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.9">1.1.9.</a>
              <strong>"Language" refers to the spoken language in a torrent.</strong> If they speak Japanese, use Japanese. If they speak English, use English. The exception is manga, where there is no spoken language. In this case, "Language" refers to the language of the text. Games are a bit more complicated, and are explained in their own section.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.10"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.10">1.1.10.</a>
              <strong>Subtitles are assumed to be in English.</strong> If a torrent contains only Japanese or other non-English subtitles, do not tag it as having subtitles. As with languages, torrents with multiple subtitles are fine so long as they contain at least English subtitles.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.11"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="r1.1.11">1.1.11.</a>
              <strong>Official English titles win.</strong> Translation can be hard. Some titles may have never been translated into English. We don't expect you to be a translator. If there's no official title, use the best English title you can find. If you find a torrent group with a poor English translation and you think you have a better one, you may replace it, so long as you're not replacing an official title. If you're unsure if your translation is better, ask a staff member for assistance, that way when they say yes and it's a shit translation, we can yell at them instead of you.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.12"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.12">1.1.12.</a>
              <strong>Watermarked uploads are allowed</strong>, however they may be trumpable by non-watermarked uploads (see <a href="#r2.2.7">rule 2.2.7.</a>).
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.13"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.13">1.1.13.</a>
              <strong>Artist and idol names must be formatted with the surname first.</strong> Uehara Ai, not Ai Uehara. Exception: artists and idols whose names are explicitly formatted differently are fine.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.14"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.14">1.1.14.</a>
              <strong>No protected archives.</strong> Archived releases must not be password protected.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.1.15"><a href="#h1.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.1.15">1.1.15.</a>
              <strong>DO NOT PUT METADATA IN THE TITLE FIELD.</strong> You know what goes in the title field? The god damn title. Not the artist. Not the langauge. Not whether or not its censored. The fucking title. <strong>Metadata should go in the proper fields.</strong> Next person I see putting dumb shit in the title field, especially if that dumb shit is release-specific like language or resolution, I'm banning your dense ass on the spot.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h5 id="h1.2"><a href="#h1.2k"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#h1.2">1.2.</a> General Formatting</h5>
        <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px;">
          <ul>
            <li id="r1.2.1"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.1">1.2.1.</a>
              <strong>Releases must be in a directory that contains the files.</strong> They may not be archived. Exception: Single-file torrents may be uploaded on their own, without a directory.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.2"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.2">1.2.2.</a>
              <strong>Directories should have meaningful titles.</strong> E.g., "Title - Catalogue Number" or "Studio - Title". The minimum acceptable is "Title", although it is preferable to include more information. Uploads that do not follow this rule are trumpable.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.3"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.3">1.2.3.</a>
              <strong>Files within directories should have meaningful names.</strong> E.g., for uploads containing multiple parts or episodes, they should include the episode number. Torrents that do not follow this rule are trumpable. Exception: WEB releases may be uploaded with file names as-is.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.4"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.5">2.1.5.</a>
              <strong>Files should sort appropriately.</strong> If your upload contains multiple parts or episodes, they should sort according to the episode number. For example, "<samp>Episode Title - 01.mkv</samp>" and "<samp>Episode Name - 02.mkv</samp>" would sort out of order. Instead, use something like "<samp>01 - Episode Title.mkv</samp>" and "<samp>02 - Episode Name.mkv</samp>" to ensure they sort correctly. Torrents that do not follow this rule are trumpable. Exception: WEB releases may be uploaded with file name as-is.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.5"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.5">1.2.5.</a>
              <strong>Avoid creating unnecessary nested folders (such as an extra folder for the actual video) inside your properly named directory.</strong> A torrent with unnecessary nested folders is trumpable by a torrent with such folders removed. For single-disc videos, all files must be included in the main torrent folder. For multi-disc videos, the main torrent folder may include sub-folders that hold the file contents for each of the discs. Additional folders are unnecessary because they do nothing to improve the organization of the torrent. If you are uncertain about what to do for other cases, PM a staff member for guidance.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.6"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.6">1.2.6.</a>
              <strong>Torrents should never have [REQ] or [REQUEST] in the title or artist name.</strong> If you fill a request using the <a href="requests.php">Requests system</a>, everyone who voted for it will be automatically notified.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.7"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.7">1.2.7.</a> <strong>Torrent titles must accurately reflect the actual titles.</strong> Use proper capitalization when giving titles. Typing titles in all lowercase letters or all capital letters is unacceptable and makes the torrent trumpable. Exceptions: If the album uses special capitalization, then you may follow that convention.</li>
            <li id="r1.2.8"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.8">1.2.8.</a>
              <strong>The Artist field in the torrent name should contain only the artist name.</strong> Do not add additional information about the artist in the artist field unless the work credits the artist in that manner. It is recommended that you search existing torrents for the artist name so that you can be sure that you name the artist the exact same way. A torrent with a proper artist name will be grouped with the existing torrents for that artist on a common artist page, and thus will be easy to find. Capitalization problems will also make a torrent trumpable. Labeling the artist incorrectly prevents your torrent from being grouped with the other torrents for the same artist.
            </li>
            <li id="r1.2.9"><a href="#h1.2"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> <a href="#r1.2.9">1.2.9.</a>
              <strong>Torrent contents should be clean.</strong> Torrents should contain <strong>only</strong> relevant files. Do <strong>not</strong> include files such as promotional images or videos, screenshots, thumbs, ripper or encoder information, or urls to other sites. The exceptions are WEB releases, which may be uploaded as-released and games, which may contain files such as READMEs.

              <strong>Trumps will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</strong> Generally, a torrent with sufficiently higher quality will be considered to trump a lower-quality one. If you are reporting a torrent as trumped, be sure to explain why you believe it should be trumped.
