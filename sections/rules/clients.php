  <h3>Further Rules</h3>
  <div class="box pad rule_summary">
    <p>
      The modification of clients to bypass our client requirements (spoofing) is explicitly forbidden. People caught doing this will be instantly and permanently banned. When you leak peers, everyone loses. This is your only warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of clients or proxies which have been modified to report incorrect stats to the tracker (cheating) is not allowed, and will result in a permanent ban. Feel free to keep doing it on other trackers, though. That's their problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testing of unstable clients by developers is not allowed unless approved by a staff member.
